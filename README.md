# gazeanalysislib
A Matlab-library for gaze analysis.

### What is gazeanalysislib?

gazeanalysislib is an open-source project created by psychology researchers and
engineers to facilitate common gaze-analysis tasks. gazeanalysislib contains
functions to load gazefiles into Matlab, to cut data, to extract various features (for example, first time in AOI, last time in AOI, time at AOI etc), and to
visualize data. The functions are not dependent on the tracker type or model. Most functions are relatively low-level, easy to understand and modify, and adaptable for different analysis requirements. The functions can be flexibly chained to build complex analysis pipelines for processing large numbers of eye tracking datafiles.

### Platforms
Matlab on any system. Octave is a free alternative, but currently we havent
tested it. Most functions work without any additional Matlab toolboxes, but
there may be exceptions.

### License
gazeanalysislib uses MIT licence.

### Reference
The project was started by researchers from Infant Cognition Lab, University of Tampere, Finland (http://uta.fi/med/icl). Please cite the following article if you publish using gazeanalysislib:

## Usage
### Terminology
* gazefile = a file that contains datapoints from a recording
* HEADERS = a commonly appearing datastruct. A 1xn cell-vector that contains
  the "column"-identifiers or headers.
* DATA = a commonly appearing datastruct. A 1xn cell-vector that contains
  vectors (cell or numerical) of datapoints. The vectors inside the cell
  represent the "data-columns" in a csv-style data. Each vector is an mx1
  numerical or cell vector.
* AOI = Area Of Interest, a square-shape area that is defined by coordinates
x1,y1,x2,y2.

### Basics
The library can be downloaded from here and the extracted folder added to
Matlab-path. After that the library functions can be called and/or a script
file containing function calls can be made.

#### Example datafile
Our git distribution includes an example file with example analysis. You can try
and run the example by downloading gazeanalysislib, opening Matlab, going to
gazeanalysislib folder and typing command:
```
example_script
```
The script analyses a file found in folder example_data and puts the resultfile
to the same directory.

#### Example script
A short example of an analysis constructed with gazeanalysislib.
```
% Simple analysis example
% First define some parameters
ending = '.gazedata';
folder = [pwd filesep 'gazedata' filesep];
medianfilterlen = 7; % datapoints, for 60Hz
accepted_validities = [0 1];

% [xstart xend ystart yend] 0..1
my_aoi = [0.4 0.6 0.4 0.6];

% Get all the files with .gazedata extension.
files = findGazeFilesInFolder(folder, ending);

% Initialize round-counter
rc = 1;

for j = 1:length(files)

    % Load one datafile
    % The parameters given here depends on the structure of your file. How
    % many columns it has and what kind of data is in the columns.
    [DATA, HEADERS] = loadCsvAutomatic(files{j});

    % Find column numbers for this file so that we can pass these column
    % files as parameters to functions later.
